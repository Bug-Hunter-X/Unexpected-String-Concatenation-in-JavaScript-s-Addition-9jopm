This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in JavaScript: unexpected string concatenation when performing addition. The `bug.js` file showcases the issue, where adding a number and a string results in string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides methods to mitigate this, such as explicit type checking or using `parseInt` to convert strings to numbers before the addition operation.
